# Design Explanation:
The map design was created with a realistic aproach of a military base within a village that our soviet spy must infiltrate.
As a result, civilians were added wandering throughout the city while there are german soilders that are patrolling the base entrances and the city. For the guards it makes sense for the guards to be able to patrol and chase the player so those two AI scripts were added to the guards.
